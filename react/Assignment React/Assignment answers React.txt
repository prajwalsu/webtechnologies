REACT JS 		  
===================================================
Assignment 1 
===================================================
1. What is React JS ? 
==>
React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook

React is a User Interface (UI) library

React is a tool for building UI components

2. Why React ?
==>
React is an excellent tool with which to create interactive applications for mobile, 
web, and other platforms. React's popularity and usage are increasing day by day for good reason. 
As a developer, coding in React makes you better at JavaScript, 
a language that holds nearly 90% of the web development share today

3. What is diff bw library and framework ?
==>
Library : Library is a part of framework, which can do single task

Framework : its is combination so many libraries, in this only some libraries are used

4. React vs React DOM
==>
 all ReactDOM functionality was part of React. 

As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. 
Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting with ReactDOM.render(). 
Another useful feature of ReactDOM is ReactDOM.findDOMNode() which you can use to gain direct access to a DOM element. 
(Something you should use sparingly in React apps, but it can be necessary.) 
If your app is "isomorphic", you would also use ReactDOM.renderToString() in your back-end code.

5. How to create react elements ?
==>
const Element = React.createElement("h1", null, "hello");
ReactDOM.render(Element, document.getElementById("container"));

6. What is Virtual DOM ? 
==> 
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, 
representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. 
This process is called reconciliation.

7. Real DOM vs Virtual DOM ? 
==>
A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, 
but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen. 
Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen.

8. What is Single Page Application ?
==>
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically
rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, 

9. What is Babel?
==>
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version 
of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                              
								//Diffing algorithm//

Diffing Algorithim works when there is a change in the root of the DOM.

/orginal/

<div>
<p> i am p</p>
</div>

/updated/ 

<script>
<p> i am p</p>
</script>

/////////////////////////

/orginal/

<div className = "style">
<p>i a p</p>
</div>


/updated/ 

<div className = "color">
<p>i a p</p>
</div>




React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM.
This “virtual” representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.
This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm.

With the help of this Algorithm React figures out which components in the UI needs to be updated. 
This process is called diffing. The algorithm that is used for the diffing process is called as the diffing algorithm. 

Once React knows which components has been updated, then it replaces the original DOM nodes with the updated DOM node.


ex:initial dom

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 2</h1>
         </div>
</section>



Updated DOM

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 5</h1>
         </div>
</section>


Now here when there is update in the UI then react compares the new virtual DOM with the pre-updated virtual DOM and points out that in the second <div> the content has been changed 
so it only updates the content of the second div in the real DOM.

Like this diffing algorithm will work.

Assignment 2 
===================================================
1. What is JSX. Explain with an example
==>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. 
It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code).

2. WAP to fetch data from 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and 
display title in web page. 


3. Example for Class component 
==> class component requires render();, return();, this keyword
ex: 
class Header extends React.Component{
    render() {
        console.log(this.props.firstName);
        console.log(this.props.lastName);
        return(
     <div>
       <div>
        <h1>i am a new header</h1>
        <p>hkjnkjnckjnzlknkjnkajjkjnkjn</p>
        <h1>hello {this.props.firstName}</h1>
       </div>
        <div></div>
     </div>
        );
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(
<div>
    <Header firstName="megha" lastName="gowda"/> 
</div>, 
document.getElementById("container")

);


4. Example for Functional Component
==> functional componenet requires return();
ex: unction Footer(props){
    let{name, age} = props;
    return(
        <h1>
            name:{name} - age:{age}
        </h1>
    );
}

ReactDOM.render(
<div>
    <Footer name="Avi" age="22" />
</div>
    ,document.getElementById("container"));

5. What are props ? 
==>The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

6. Difference bw Class and Functional Components 
==> 
Functional Components:A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
There is no render method used in functional components.
 
Class component: A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. 

     
7. Explain Diffing Algorithm and Complexity of Algorithm
==>
React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM.
This “virtual” representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.
This comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm.

With the help of this Algorithm React figures out which components in the UI needs to be updated. 
This process is called diffing. The algorithm that is used for the diffing process is called as the diffing algorithm. 

Once React knows which components has been updated, then it replaces the original DOM nodes with the updated DOM node.


ex:initial dom

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 2</h1>
         </div>
</section>



Updated DOM

<section>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React</h1>
         </div>
         <div>
               <h1>Hello React 5</h1>
         </div>
</section>


Now here when there is update in the UI then react compares the new virtual DOM with the pre-updated virtual DOM and points out that in the second <div> the content has been changed 
so it only updates the content of the second div in the real DOM.

Like this diffing algorithm will work.


8. What is Babel 
==>Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version 
of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

9. Explain key attribute ? Why key attribute need to be used
==> Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
