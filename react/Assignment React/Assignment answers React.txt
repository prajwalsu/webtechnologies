REACT JS 		  
===================================================
Assignment 1 
===================================================
1. What is React JS ? 
==>
React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook

React is a User Interface (UI) library

React is a tool for building UI components

2. Why React ?
==>
React is an excellent tool with which to create interactive applications for mobile, 
web, and other platforms. React's popularity and usage are increasing day by day for good reason. 
As a developer, coding in React makes you better at JavaScript, 
a language that holds nearly 90% of the web development share today

3. What is diff bw library and framework ?
==>
Library : Library is a part of framework, which can do single task

Framework : its is combination so many libraries, in this only some libraries are used

4. React vs React DOM
==>
 all ReactDOM functionality was part of React. 

As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. 
Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting with ReactDOM.render(). 
Another useful feature of ReactDOM is ReactDOM.findDOMNode() which you can use to gain direct access to a DOM element. 
(Something you should use sparingly in React apps, but it can be necessary.) 
If your app is "isomorphic", you would also use ReactDOM.renderToString() in your back-end code.

5. How to create react elements ?
==>
const Element = React.createElement("h1", null, "hello");
ReactDOM.render(Element, document.getElementById("container"));

6. What is Virtual DOM ? 
==> 
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, 
representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. 
This process is called reconciliation.

7. Real DOM vs Virtual DOM ? 
==>
A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, 
but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen. 
Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen.

8. What is Single Page Application ?
==>
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically
rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, 

9. What is Babel?
==>
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version 
of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

Diffing Algorithim works when there is a change in the root of the DOM.
